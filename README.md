## Requirements

- _Node_ = `14.*`
- _Yarn_ = `1.*`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you might run:

### `make start`

It also correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance and extract it to the `build` folder and start the application.

### `make dev`

**ps**. Remember you can also use production's URL directly [here](http://only-pizza-burger-or-sushi.guicheffer.me/).

Runs the app in the development mode. üî•<br />
Make sure you manually open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `make test-stuff`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### `make test-coverage`

This will generate a coverage folder with more details to be exported afterwards.

### `make i` | `make install`

Install dependencies from yarn's package.json.

### `make help`

Please execute that in order to be aware of what commands you might be able to run.

## Ideas

- [ ] **UX** <br/>
  - I understand there are many things and many other features that could be added in ‚Äì therefore, I wasn't really worried since I would like to spend, like recommended, max 4 hours in this little POC;
- [ ] **Acessibility** <br/>
  - I'm really sorry but I wasn't very successful in Acessibility here - I could have that improved a lot;
  - ...honestly, acessibility looks terrible! üòî
- [ ] **Architectural** <br/>
  - The simple architecture choices here were taking agility into account, that's why I considered not improving it a lot;
- [ ] **Performance** <br/>
  - I believe there's a lot of space for performance here;
- [ ] **Reusable Code** <br/>
  - I tried my best, however, I knew if I had more time, (as I've been a bit busy recently), I would tackle it to improve a bit the performance.
  - I also wanted to add [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) on this project but then, time expired a bit :(
    - We could use the components from the `components/shared/` folder in order to migrate our Storybook comps, for example.
  - **ps**. I also added some comments across the codebase to explain a bit better how things are separated as per the concerns;
